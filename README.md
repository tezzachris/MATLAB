## Some Matlab Fixes?

1) How to get non-empty elements from an array
2) How to do multiple assignments ex. function "deal" 

   [a,b] = deal(1,2); 
   returns a=1 and b=2
    
   but suppose this example:
   coeff = [1,2]; 
   [a,b] = deal(coeff); 
   returns a = [1,2] and b=[1,2] 

   So is not really useful
